# Defender for Cloud - Defender CSPM Workbook
**Author: Giulio Astori**

The Azure Workbook for Defender CSPM Visualization is a dashboard designed to enhance the visualization and analysis of Defender for Cloud's Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) information. This workbook provides a centralized and intuitive single pane of view within the Azure Portal, allowing users to easily access and crucial information related to Defender CSPM.

Defender CSPM capabilities are highly valuable for ensuring the security and compliance of cloud environments. However, the native Azure Portal lacks a consolidated view that offers users a holistic understanding of the Defender CSPM insights. We have developed the Azure Workbook for Defender CSPM Visualization to bridge the divide and empower users with an efficient and informative dashboard.
