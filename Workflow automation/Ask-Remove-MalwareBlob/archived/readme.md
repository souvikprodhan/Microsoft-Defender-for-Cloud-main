**Additional Post Install Notes:**

After deployment go to the Logic App and API Connections Blade to authorize the o365 API Connection so that email will send.

The Logic App creates and uses a Managed System Identity (MSI) to DELETE against the blob uri. 

Assign RBAC 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' and 'Security Admin' role to the Logic App at the root Management Group level or Subscription.
