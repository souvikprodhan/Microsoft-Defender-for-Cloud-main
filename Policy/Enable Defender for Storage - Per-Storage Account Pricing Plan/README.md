## Microsoft Defender for Storage Enable the Per-Storage Account Pricing Plan

> ## Important note
>  
A new pricing plan is now available for Microsoft Defender for Cloud that charges you according to the number of storage accounts it protects (per-storage). The cost in the legacy pricing plan increases according to the number of analyzed transactions in the storage account (per-transaction). The new per-storage plan fixes costs per storage account but accounts with an exceptionally high transaction volume incur an overage charge. For details about the pricing plans, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/)

> The new per-storage plan is only supported on public clouds, and can be enabled only at the subscription level
> The exclusion of storage accounts from protected subscriptions will only be supported in the future.

Microsoft Defender for Storage is an Azure-native layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts. It uses advanced threat detection capabilities and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) data to provide contextual security alerts. Those alerts also include steps to mitigate the detected threats and prevent future attacks.

Microsoft Defender for Storage continuously analyzes the transactions of [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/), [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), and [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/) services. When potentially malicious activities are detected, security alerts are generated. Alerts are shown in Microsoft Defender for Cloud with the details of the suspicious activity, appropriate investigation steps, remediation actions, and security recommendations. [Learn more about the capabilities here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-storage-introduction).

This Azure policy definition allows you to enable the new per-storage pricing plan on your subscriptions and management groups.
