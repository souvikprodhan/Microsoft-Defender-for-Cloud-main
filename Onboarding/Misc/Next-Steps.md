After successfully onboarding all enterprise subscriptions and customizing MDC to their needs, the customerâ€™s central security team should regularly monitor the MDC Secure Score and see it as a key performance indicator for their security posture.

The following articles can help customers to establish a routine in regularly checking MDC recommendations and alerts:
*	[Monitor the security health of your Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-monitoring)
*	[Manage security recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/review-security-recommendations)
*	[Learn how to remediate recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-remediate-recommendations)
*	[Manage and respond to security alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts)
*	[Prevent misconfigurations with Enforce/Deny](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/prevent-misconfigurations)
