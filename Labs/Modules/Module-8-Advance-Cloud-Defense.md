## Objectives
Defender for Servers offers threat detection and advanced cloud defense capabilities for compute workloads. This includes Just In Time (JIT) VM Access to protect a machine's management ports, File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and Adaptive Application Controls to track changes and running applications on machines, but also OS-level threat detection offered by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and network layer threat detection for Azure VMs, including DNS- and network-based attacks.
In this exercise, you will understand how some of these enhanced capabilities in Defender for Servers Plan 2 are enabled to help you protect compute workloads in cloud environments.

### Exercise 1: Enable Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2
To enable the Defender plan on a specific subscription:
1.	Sign into the **Azure portal**.
2.	Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, then **Environment settings**.
3.	Select the relevant subscription.
4.  Locate Servers. 
5.	Ensure the **Status** is toggled **On**.
6.	Click on **Settings** and ensure all of them are toggled **On**.
7. Click **Continue** and **Save**. 

Now all your existing and upcoming Azure VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers are protected.

### Exercise 2: Using JIT to reduce attack surface

1.	From Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, click on **Workload Protections**.
2.	On the Advanced protection part at the bottom, click on **Just-in-time VM access** (You should see 2 unprotected status).

![Advanced protection options](../Images/asc-defender-advanced-protection-jit.gif?raw=true)

3.	On the Just-in-time VM access page, select the **Not configure** tab. You should see at least two virtual machines listed: `asclab-linux` and `asclab-win`.
4.	Select **asclab-win** and then click on the **Enable JIT on 1 VM** button.

5.	On the JIT VM access configuration, keep just the **3389 (RDP) port** and delete others.  
![JIT VM access configuration](../Images/asc-jit-vm-access-config.gif?raw=true)
6.	Click **Save** to apply the VM access configuration.
7.	Review the **Configured** tab, now you should see your VM configured: `asclab-win`.
8.	On the Azure portal sidebar, click on **Virtual Machines**.
9.	Click on **asclab-win**.
10.	From the top menu, click on **Connect** button and then select **RDP**.

11.	Return to the VM blade. On the Connect page, request JIT access. On the **Source IP**, select **My IP** and then click on **Request access**. You should now see the following message: *Download file*.

12.	Try to connect again to validate your JIT access to the VM. Use the same file you downloaded previously.
13.	Now you should get the prompt for the local admin credentials. **Type your username and password** and click **OK**.
14.	You **are now connected to asclab-win** server. Close the remote control session/log off.

### Exercise 3: Adaptive Application Control

Application control helps you deal with malicious and/or unauthorized software, by allowing only specific applications to run on your machines.

1.	From Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, click on **Workload Protections**.
2.	On the Advanced protection part at the bottom, click on **Adaptive application control**.

![](../Images/lab8aac.gif?raw=true)
3.	The Adaptive application controls page opens with your VMs grouped into the following tabs: Configured, Recommended and No recommendations.
4.	Click on the **Recommended** tab.
5.	If this tab does not contain any group yet, it means that Microsoft Defender for Cloud needs at least two weeks of data to define the unique recommendations per group of machines.

### Exercise 4: File Integrity Monitoring

File integrity monitoring (FIM), also known as change monitoring, examines operating system files, Windows registries, application software, Linux system files, and more, for changes that might indicate an attack.
It maps the current state of these items with the state during the previous scan and alerts you if suspicious modifications have been made. To enable FIM, follow the instructions below:

1.	From Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, click on **Workload Protections**.
2.	On the Advanced protection part at the bottom, click on **File Integrity Monitoring** tile.
3.	On the FIM configuration page, select the Log Analytics workspace **asclab-la-xxx**.
![](../Images/mdfc-fim.png?raw=true)
4.	On the Enable FIM, **review the default recommended settings** for Windows files, Registry and Linux files.
5.	Click on **Enable File Integrity Monitoring** button.

You'll now be able to track changes to files in resource associated with the log analytics workspace.
