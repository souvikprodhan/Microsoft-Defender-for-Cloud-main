# Enable Azure Defender plans on subscriptions
**Author: Tom Janetscheck**

~~These policies help you to automatically activate Azure Defender plans on your subscriptions.~~

## Deprecation notice
These custom policy definitions are deprecated as in the meantime, Azure Policy comes with built-in definitions to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans on your subscriptions or management groups. For further details, please refer to the [Azure Policy documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#security-center).

### How to find the right policy definition
All built-in definitions to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans have a name similar to
"Configure Azure Defender for [plan name] to be enabled". In the documentation mentioned above, you can click the corresponding policy name and are automatically redirected to the policy definition in your Azure environment.
